# Making Your Own Charts

You can utilize the `@ichef/transcharts-graph` and `@ichef/transcharts-chart` packages to create charts with X and Y axis.


### Calculate Chart Dimensions

The `useChartDimensions` lets you get the `outerDimension` and `graphDimension`.

By attaching the ref to the outer chart (`chartRef`), the ref to the title box (`titleRef`), the legend (`legendRef`), and the inner margin of the chart,
it calcultates the following dimensions:

- Full dimension of the chart: `outerDimension` (see the blue text on the graph below)
- Inner dimension of the chart: `graphDimension` (see the orange text on the graph below)

```js
  const {
    chartRef,
    titleRef,
    legendRef,
    outerDimension,
    graphDimension,
  } = useChartDimensions(margin);
```

It calculates the width and height of a component using `useContainerDimension` hook of the graph package.


### SvgWithAxisFrame

`<SvgWithAxisFrame>` is the component that draws the following basics components of a chart for you:

- The title and description of the chart (`<HeaderBox>`)
- The SVG to draw the chart along with the X and Y axes (the axes are drawn using `<AxisLayer>`).
- The transformed inner SVG element container `<g>` to draw the main SVG components  (yello area on the chart above).

Pass the following props to draw a chart:

- `children`: the main SVG components like the bars, lines, or dots to be drawn on the transformed inner SVG element container `<g>` (yello area on the chart above).
- `svgOverlay`: the non-SVG components like the tooltip and legend.

You may refer to the source code of `<LineChart>` or `<BarChart>` as an example.
