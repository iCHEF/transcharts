# Making Your Own Charts

You can utilize the `@ichef/transcharts-graph` and `@ichef/transcharts-chart` packages to create charts with X and Y axis.


## Calculate Chart Dimensions

The `useChartDimensions` lets you get the `outerDimension` and `graphDimension`.

By attaching the ref to the outer chart (`chartRef`), the ref to the title box (`titleRef`), the legend (`legendRef`), and the inner margin of the chart,
it calcultates the following dimensions:

- Full dimension of the chart: `outerDimension` (see the blue text on the graph below)
- Inner dimension of the chart: `graphDimension` (see the orange text on the graph below)

```js
  const {
    chartRef,
    titleRef,
    legendRef,
    outerDimension,
    graphDimension,
  } = useChartDimensions(margin);
```

It calculates the width and height of a component using `useContainerDimension` hook of the graph package.


## SvgWithAxisFrame

`<SvgWithAxisFrame>` is the component that draws the following basics components of a chart for you:

- The title and description of the chart (`<HeaderBox>`)
- The SVG to draw the chart along with the X and Y axes (the axes are drawn using `<AxisLayer>`).
- The transformed inner SVG element container `<g>` to draw the main SVG components  (yello area on the chart above).

Pass the following props to draw a chart:

- `children`: the main SVG components like the bars, lines, or dots to be drawn on the transformed inner SVG element container `<g>` (yello area on the chart above).
- `svgOverlay`: the non-SVG components like the tooltip and legend.

You may refer to the source code of `<LineChart>` or `<BarChart>` as an example.


## Add Tooltips/Hovering Effects

To detect the mouse and touch events, you can add a `<HoverLayer>` component
in which you can put `hoverDetectionComponents` which are an array of transparent svg elements to be attached with the mouse and touch events.

`<HoverLayer>` detects the X and Y position and the index of the `hoverDetectionComponents` array are being hovered,
and sets such information using the passed in prop `setHoveredPosAndIndex(...)`.
It also calls the passed in `clearHovering()` to clear the hovering index when users hover/touch out of the regions of `hoverDetectionComponents`.

The `setHoveredPosAndIndex(...)` and `clearHovering()` can be gotten from `useHoverState` hook
which also lets you get `hovering` (whether users are hovering/touching the `hoverDetectionComponents`)
and `hoveredPoint` (the index of `hoverDetectionComponents` and the X and Y position).

You can use `hovering` and `hoverDetectionComponents` to create visual hovering effect or add tooltips.

To draw the tooltip, there is `<TooltipLayer>` to help you create it with ease.
