# Clipping Rectangle

You can make an inner SVG element be clipped by an animated rectangle by wrapping it into `<AnimatedClipRect>`.

The default animation direction is enlarging the clipping rectangle from the left to the right, i.e., `slideRight`.
While it supports four kinds of directions (`slideRight`, `slideLeft`, `slideUp`, `slideDown`), and you can modify it directly through the playground below to see different effects.

Additionally, the `easing` options corresponds to the names of the [d3-ease](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease) functions.
You may refer to its [document](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease) to choose a desirable easing effect.

<Playground>
  <svg width={550} height={50}>
    <AnimatedClipRect
      width={550}
      height={50}
      type="slideRight"
      duration={1500}
      easing='easeCubic'>
      <rect
        width={550}
        height={50}
        rx={10}
        style={{ fill: '#2f98f7' }}
      />
    </AnimatedClipRect>
  </svg>
</Playground>
