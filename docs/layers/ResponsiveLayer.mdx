# Responsive Layer

> **Note:** You may use our [useContainerDimension Hook](/hooks/use_container_dimension) to get the width and height of a DOM element instead,
so that you can avoid unnecessary nestings of the JSX syntax.

The `<ResponsiveLayer>` component is one of the most important building blocks of creating responsive graphs.

It fits the full width and height of the parent component, and it provides its `width` and `height` using the [render props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) pattern.

You may interact with the following example by resizing the width of the Playground below or the height of the window:

<Playground>
  <div style={{ height: '12vh' }}>
    <ResponsiveLayer>
      {({ width, height }) => (
        <div>
          <p>Width: {width}</p>
          <p>Height: {height}</p>
        </div>
      )}
    </ResponsiveLayer>
  </div>
</Playground>


## Props

<Props of={ResponsiveLayer} />
